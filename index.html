        <h3>Q .1 What is difference between '==' and '===' operator?</h3>
        <p>Ans. We can say that both are comparison operators and they returned the boolean value.If we talk about '==' operator that
            is used to compare both the values whereas '===' operator is used to compare both the values as well as it's datatype.

            var x="2"
            var y=2
            console.log(x==y);
            console.log(x===y);

        <h3>Q .2 What is the spread operator?</h3>
        <p>The javascript spread operator(...) used to destructured the non-premitive data types. <br>
        Ex.- array , objects</p>
        <pre>
            const arr1=[1,2,3]
            const arr2=[4,5,6]
            const arr=[...arr1,...arr2]
            console.log(arr)

        <h3>Q .4 What is execution context?</h3>
        <p>
            The Execution Context contains the code that's currently running, and everything that aids in its execution.
            During the Execution Context run-time, the specific code gets parsed by a parser, the variables and functions are stored in memory, executable byte-code gets generated, and the code gets executed.
        </p>

        <h3>Q .5.What is meant by first class function?</h3>
        <p>In any Programming language, when a function is treated as a variable then it is called as First class Function.<br><li>we can assign a function to a variable</li><br><li>We can pass a function as an argument in other functions.</li><br><li>returning a function</li><br><li>Arrow Functions etc..,Examples are:</li>
            <pre>
                1.Function to a variable:
                let myfunction=function(){
                    console.log("hi");
                }
                myfunction();

                2.function as a argument:
                function greet(){
                    console.log("Happy")
                }
                function specialgreet(callback,message){
                    console.log(callback(),message)
                }
                specialgreet(greet,"Hello friend");

                3.return a function:
                function outer(){
                    var x=10;
                    function inner(){
                        console.log(x);
                    }
                    return inner();
                }
                let out = outer();
                console.log(out());
            </pre>
        <hr>
        <h3>6.What are closures? Give an example of closure</h3>
            <p>clousure is a combination of a function enclosed with its surrounding state(lexical environment).
            A clousure gives you acccess to an outer function scope from an inner function.In js clousures are created
            every time when ever a function is created.</p>
            <pre>
                function outer(){
                    var x=10;
                    function inner(){
                        console.log(x);
                    }
                    return inner()
                }
                let out=outer()
                console.log(out);
            </pre>
        <hr>
        <h3>7.Explain call(),apply(),and bind() methods?</h3>
            <p>These three methods are used to invoke a function where we are supposed to pass an object as first argument.we can access the values of the object by using this keyword in function definition.<br><br>Call():Call()method invokes a function in which first argument will be a object and rest of the arguments required by function will be provided as an individual arguments.<br><br>
            apply():apply() method invokes a function in which the first argument will be an object and rest of arguments will be passed as a array of elements.<br><br>bind():bind() method returns a new function and this function will be having a reference of object passed,now,where ever you wants to use this function in the code you can use it by passing the rest of arguments.</p>
